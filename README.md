The Programming Portfolio must be in C# language and performative source code platform (I used VSCode and Github) and include
includes required data structures, four optional algorithms, and a challenge item.

#**The Required Data Structures include:**

Dynamic Array (must support any data type, resizing automatically), Singly Linked List (must be singly linked, with a Node class supporting any data type), Stack (can use a dynamic array or linked list; must follow LIFO principle), Queue (can use a dynamic array or linked list; must follow FIFO principle), Slow Sort (implement Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort), Fast Sort (implement Quick Sort or Merge Sort), and Binary Search Tree (basic implementation without balancing)

#**The Optional Algorithms include:**

Double-Ended Queue, AVL Trees, Tries, Heaps (Heapsort or Priority Queue), Skip List, Hash Table, or Bloom Filter

#**The Challenge Item includes:**

Red-Black Trees or Graph with Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm
