# CSC-3102 Programming Portfolio

The Programming Portfolio must be in C# language and performative source code platform (I used VSCode and Github) and include
required data structures, four optional algorithms, and a challenge item. It should be created to show data structures and advanced algorithmic implementations.

#**The Required Data Structures include:**

Dynamic Array (must support any data type, resizing automatically), Singly Linked List (must be singly linked, with a Node class supporting any data type), Stack (can use a dynamic array or linked list; must follow LIFO principle), Queue (can use a dynamic array or linked list; must follow FIFO principle), Slow Sort (implement Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort), Fast Sort (implement Quick Sort or Merge Sort), and Binary Search Tree (basic implementation without balancing)

#**The Optional Algorithms include:**

Double-Ended Queue, AVL Trees, Tries, Heaps (Heapsort or Priority Queue), Skip List, Hash Table, or Bloom Filter

#**The Challenge Item includes:**

Red-Black Trees or Graph with Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Path Algorithm

#**Implementation Instructions for Algorithm:**

It is recommended to start with Dynamic Array or Singly Linked List, then implement a Node class.
For Dynamic Array: Use a primitive array inside the class; Use methods such as "DyanmicArray()", "Add(Atype item, int pos)", "Remove(int pos)", and "Size()". For Singly Linked List: Use the Node class with data of any type and reference it to the next Node; Use methods such as "LinkedList()", "AddAt(Ltype item, int pos)", "RemovalAt(int pos)", "Get(int pos)", "Set(Ltype val, int pos), and "Size()". For Stack: It can be implemented using a dynamic array or linked list; Use methods such as "Stack()", "Push(Stype item)", "Pop()", "Peek()", and "Size()".For Queue: It can be implemented using a dynamic array or linked list; Use methods such as "Queue()", "Enqueue(Qtype item)", "Dequeue()", "Peek()", and "Size()". For Slow Sort: It can be implemented as Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort; Use methods such as "static void Sort(int[]list)". For Fast Sort: It can be implemented as Quick Sort or Merge Sort; Use methods such as "static void Sort(int[] list)". For Binary Search Tree: No balancing is required and only support the integers; Use methods such as "Binary Tree()", "Add(int val)", "Remove(int val)", "Has(int val)", and "Height()".
